                  <h2>ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                  <p>Thank you for visiting SupplyCopia’s Online Platform and viewing this privacy policy. We use this policy to tell you about the types of information we collect from you when you visit our site or use authorized features or apps that link to this policy. More specifically, this policy tells you: </p>

                   <ul>
                  <li> <a>The types of information we collect and how we collect it;</a></li>
                  <li> <a>The ways in which we use, share and protect that information; </a></li>
                  <li> <a>The choices you have in controlling the collection of your information; and </a></li>
                  <li> <a>Your ability to access and update your information</a></li>
               </ul>
               <p>By using our sites or other online authorized features or apps, you are signifying to us that you agree with this policy. Although the Online Platform may contain links to other web sites controlled by third parties, you should be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those, or any other, sites. If you have questions about how those web sites collect and use data, you should carefully read those sites’ privacy policies. </p>
               <p>This privacy policy is effective as of January 01, 2020. Future changes to this policy will be handled as described below.</p>


               <p><span>Some Important Vocabulary</span>
                  This privacy policy is a legal document, so clarity is important. We’ll use this section to let you know about some words that have special meanings whenever you see them in this policy. Let’s start with the word <span>“policy”</span> itself: when we reference <span>“this policy”,“this privacy policy”</span> and <span>“our policy”,</span> we mean the SupplyCopia Online Privacy Policy you are reading now. Wherever we say <span>“SupplyCopia”</span> or <span>“we”, “us”</span> or <span>“our”</span>, we mean Nogpo, Inc. d/b/a SupplyCopia and its affiliates. We use the words <span>“you”</span> and <span>“your”</span> to mean you, the reader, and other visitors to our site who are, in all cases, over the age of 18. This age requirement is discussed in more detail below. You also will notice that we capitalize certain additional words in this privacy policy even though grammatical rules do not require. We do this because in the context of this policy, such capitalized words have specific meanings which can be found where they are first used, as indicated by bold text.
                  </p>



               <p>Whenever we reference <span>“this site”</span>, <span>“our site”</span> or <span>“the site”,</span> we mean the SuuplyCopia web site found at <a href="https://supplycopia.com/">www.supplycopia.com</a> and such others as we may make available from time to time. When we talk about “authorized features or apps”, we’re referring both to elements of our social media presence viewable from Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, LinkedIn or any of the many other available external third party social media platforms, as well as mobile or other apps we’ve created and distributed to let our customers and followers view our site or otherwise interact with our content. Last, but definitely not least, when we refer to <span>“personal information”,</span> we mean information that can be used to identify you or that can be easily linked to you. Thus, a fairly comprehensive list of “personal information” would include such things as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, email address, social security number and date of birth. Note, a domain name or an internet protocol address would not be considered personal information except where the law directly applicable to our collection of it says otherwise.</p>

               <p><span>Please be a Grown Up:</span> <em>User Age Requirements and Children’s Privacy:-</em>
                  Federal law imposes special restrictions and obligations on commercial website operators who direct their operations toward, and collect and use information from children under the age of 13. We take those age-related requirements seriously, and consistent with it do not intend for this site or any of our authorized features or apps to be used by children under the age of 18, and certainly not by anyone under the age of 13. Moreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 18. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has submitted personal information to our site, we will delete that information and will not use it for any purpose whatsoever. We encourage parents and legal guardians to talk with their children about the potential risks of providing personal information over the Internet
                  </p>
                 <p> <span>Nothing Personal:</span> <em>Automatically Collected Information and Our Use of Cookies:-</em>
                  When you visit our site and agree to their use, basic information is passively collected through your web browser via use of tracking technologies, such as a “cookie” which is a small text file that is downloaded onto your computer or mobile device when you access the site. It allows us to recognize your computer or mobile device and store some information about your preferences or past actions. If you do not allow cookies to be set on your computer or mobile device, you may be unable to access certain parts of our site or certain parts of our site may have reduced functionality. Additional information about cookies and tracking technologies is available below.</p> 

               <p>We use ‘analytical’ cookies that are both session (they expire when you close your browser) and persistent (they remain in operation even after you have closed your browser) types of cookies. We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time following your use of the site. If we engage third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies for purposes other than those stated above, we will update this privacy policy with that information. </p>

               <p>The information we collect through cookies and other means is <span>not personal information</span> and does not individually identify you. It includes things like

                  </p>

               <ul>
                  <li> <a> The type of browser and operating system you use</a></li>   
                  <li> <a> The date and time and length of your visit</a></li>   
                  <li> <a>He specific page visited, graphics viewed and any documents downloaded </a></li>   
                  <li> <a> The specific links to other sites you accessed from our site</a></li>
                  <li> <a> In some cases, the domain name and IP address from which you accessed our site </a></li>
               </ul>

               <p>Mobile devices are one possible exception to the rule that our passive, automatic collection activities exclude personal information. We say that because, if you access our site from a phone or other mobile device, the mobile services provider may transmit to us uniquely identifiable mobile device information which allows us to then collect mobile phone numbers and associate them with the mobile device identification information. Some mobile phone service providers also operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices and we may receive this information as well. </p>
               <p>Regardless, we use both automatically collected non-personal information and mobile device information only to compile generic reports about popular pages on our site, and to see how our customers and followers are accessing our site. We then use that data to administer the site, make your activities more convenient and efficient and to enhance the functionality of our site, such as by remembering certain of your information thereby saving you time</p>
                <p><span>Now it’s Personal:</span> <em>Voluntarily Submitted Information:-</em> 
                  If you participate in certain activities on our site, you may need to provide us with information about yourself such as your name, email address, mailing address, company affiliation or phone number. For example, if you choose to send us an email or fill out an online form, you are voluntarily providing personal information to us. In doing so, you are giving us your consent to collect, use and disclose that information for the purpose it is requested and for other reasonable internal business purposes. We do not sell, rent or trade voluntarily submitted personal information with third parties.<br>
                  If you don’t want us to collect this type of personal information, don’t provide it! This means you shouldn’t participate in the activities on our sites that request or require it. Participation is strictly your choice. Not participating may limit your ability to take full advantage of the site, but it will not affect your ability to access certain information available on the site to the general public
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are some of the ways you voluntarily give us your personal information and how we use it:  </p>
                  <P><span>Emails and Online Forms </span>- When you send us an email, post personal information or upload it to our site, fill out an online form, or respond to a survey, your email address and any other personal information that may be in the content of your message or attached to it, are retained by us and used to respond back directly to you. If you prefer we not collect, use or store this information, please do not email us or submit it to us via one of the methods described above. Instead, you may want to communicate with us by phone or by regular mail</P>
                <P>Registering for an Account or a Newsletter - When you register for an account and our various newsletters, you submit personal information to us which we then retain. We use that information to create your account and establish a password and profile. We also may use any personal information you provide to customize our newsletter to make them more relevant to you. If you include your email address in your registration information we may use it to communicate with you via email. For more information about registering for an account, please visit our <a href="privacy-policy.html"> Terms of Use </a>  </P>
                <P> Becoming a Subscriber to Our Service - If you formally become a customer of our product or service offerings, you will be required to enter into a subscription, licensing or other agreement. That agreement is separate from both this policy and our related website Terms of Use and will have its own terms and conditions governing confidentiality, data privacy and data security. As a result, those terms and not this policy will apply. </P>
                <p>As we describe above, our <span>External Social Media Presence</span> that allow users to post or upload messages, comments, screen names, computer files and other materials is not governed by this policy. If you choose to make personally identifiable information public through these means, we will consider that information to be in the public domain and will not limit its disclosure in the manner described by this policy. </p>
                <p><span>How We Handle Do Not Track Signals</span> We currently do not specifically respond to browser do-not-track signals. </p>

                <P><span>Choices you can make:</span><em> Opt Out and Account Changes:-</em>
               If we are using personal information you provided to us in order to enable us to send you materials, such as newsletters via email, and you decide you don’t want to receive such materials, you may opt out by following the opt-out instructions in the email or other communication. When we receive your request, we will take reasonable steps to remove your name from our distribution lists.

                        <p class="footer-p">What you cant see can hurt you. Thats especially true in healthcare supply chain where a lack of business intelligence can lead to increased costs and poorer patient outcomes for hospitals and missed sales opportunities and new customers for suppliers.  We created SupplyCopia to do something about it by applying the latest data science and software technology to bring maximum transparency to both ends of the supply chain to the benefit of both and expense of neither.</p>
